* Fix: Remove the "Add to portfolio" button on the logged-in user's list of
       stocks, for stocks not already tracked.

* Fix: its possible to add a stock already being tracked, if hitting Add to Portfolio from a 
  friend's stock list

* Fix: It's possible to hit the Add to portfolio button multiple times and add a
  ticker symbol to the tracking table multiple times. 

* Fix: Check for stock tracked by a user by looking at the user_stocks table, 
       not the company_stocks table. Don't need the company_stocks table when refreshing the 
       stock price at each page load for display. That table can be removed.

Possible extensions:

* Add a wait cursor while the stock lookup at the 3rd party service is ongoing.
  Sometimes it has taken 20-ish seconds.
