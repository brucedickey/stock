-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Course used nodejs 12.16.0. Use that to avoid lib incompatibilities and bugs
  in the project.

* BUT Heroku uses node 16.31.1, and node-gyp 3.8.0 which has a compile error
  when used with the project's version of node.
  
* Heroku supports Ruby versions:
   2.6.9
   2.7.5
   3.0.3
   3.1.1

* Start server with `rails server` or `rails s`.

* To deploy to heroku
   After deployment, visit: https://alpha-blog-bd.herokuapp.com/, or
                       run: heroku open

   To create a heroku app on a particular stack:

      heroku create --stack heroku-18

   1. Ensure you have committed your code to your git repo, then:

     git push heroku master

   2. Then run any pending migrations:

     heroku run rake db:migrate
     or
     heroku run rails db:migrate
     

   3. Run bundle install on heroku:

     heroku run bundle install

* To undo a heroku create:

   heroku apps:destroy -a sleepy-chamber-3162

* To set admin user from heroku app run:

     heroku run rails console

  Then grab a user (example, user = User.last):

     user.toggle!(:admin)

  That will set the admin column to true

* User accounts:
     richard@q.com             richard       Richard Queue (Admin)   has stock
     rebeka@q.com              rebeka        Rebeka Queue            has stock
     robbie@q.com              robbie        Robbie Queue

* To remove all stock for a user:
     user.stocks.delete_all

* To edit the config\credentials.yml.enc file:
     EDITOR='code --wait' rails credentials:edit

* Prof's github repo is udemyrailscourse/finance-tracker-6

* It would be nice to always see the latest stock price rather than what it was
  it was added to the company_stocks table. Therefore, I'm updating the price 
  displayed from the 3rd party API whenever a stock list is shown, rather than
  read the initial last_price from the table. The last_price column is not 
  needed anymore. Also don't need the suggested enhancement of the Refresh
  button.

  With ONLY 10 stocks per user, it is not a big time hit to re-read the
  stock prices upon displaying the list of stocks.
